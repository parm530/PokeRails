# README

This rails web app is designed to be a basic version of the current app Pokemon Go. A user is able to sign up 
through Facebook (through the Omniauth-Facebook gem) or through the app's main website.

The user can "catch" pokemon through the utilization of the Ruby API wrapper Poke::API, which generates
randomly selected pokemon.

A simple battle feature is implemented based on team size and the attack stat of the pokemon in the battle.
The user is able to see other trainers and their pokemon. They can "release" unwanted pokemon only on their team.
